This year, the language of choice is Julia.

I try to come up with my own solutions, so they may not be the most optimal.

Day-specific notes:
- Day 4 part A is definitely overcomplicated.
- Day 5 part B is implemented in a stupid brute force. It takes too much time to execute.
    I just decided to grab a coffee while waiting for it to finish, instead of trying
    to implement something that works properly.
- Day 10 was funny, I made a mistake in part A that turned out to be the solution to part B.
